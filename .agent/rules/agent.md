STOP. Before responding to ANY request, you MUST:

1. Read AGENT.md (repository root) - mandatory project context
2. Read docs/ai-knowledge/README.md - knowledge base index
3. Read docs/ai-commands/README.md - available agent commands
4. Load any relevant knowledge docs based on the task

These files contain critical project conventions, patterns, and constraints that MUST inform all responses.

Only after reading these files should you proceed with the user's request.
