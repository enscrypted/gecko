## FIRST: Verify Context is Loaded

If you have NOT yet read `AGENT.md` this session, read it NOW before proceeding.
If you have NOT yet scanned `docs/ai-knowledge/README.md` for relevant topics, do so NOW.

These files contain critical project conventions. Proceeding without them leads to incorrect implementations.

## DURING SESSION

- Load KB docs when task keywords match the README index
- On EVERY user message, check triggers: commit? correction? session end? → run matching command
- When context appears lost (unable to recall project conventions), re-read AGENT.md

---

## Quick Reference

- **Stack**: Rust 2021, Tauri v2, React 18, TypeScript
- **Main branch**: `main`
- **Testing**: `cargo test --workspace`
- **Linting**: `cargo clippy --workspace`, `pnpm lint`

## Critical Constraints

- **Real-time audio** - ZERO allocations in audio callbacks
- **NO microphone input** - Gecko captures APPLICATION audio, not voice
- **Per-app EQ** - Each app has independent EQ processing BEFORE mixing
- **Frontend tokens** - Use `gecko-*` Tailwind tokens, not raw colors

## Mandatory Auto-Triggers (Do NOT Skip)

These behaviors are MANDATORY. Do not wait for user to ask:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| User says "commit", "stage", "git add" | Run `pre-commit-check` BEFORE the operation |
| KB lookup failed → solved via code search | Run `document-solution` to update KB |
| User corrects you ("that's wrong", "actually...", etc.) | Run `log-mistake` immediately |
| Modified any KB file | Run `check-kb-index` |
| User says "done", "thanks", "bye", ending session | Run `session-end-checklist` |

See `docs/ai-commands/TRIGGER-CHECKLIST.md` for full details.

## Key Patterns

- Rust crates: `crates/gecko_*/`
- Error types: Each crate uses `thiserror`
- Audio thread: Zero allocation, lock-free (`rtrb`, atomics)
- Components: CVA variants, `forwardRef`, `gecko-*` tokens
